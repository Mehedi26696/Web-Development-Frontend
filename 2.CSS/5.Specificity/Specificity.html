        <h1>Cascade Algorithm for Specificity</h1>
        <p>Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear</p>
        <p>Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match</p>
        <p>Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a
            browser extension, or your authored CSS</p>
        <p>Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
            Lets look into all these one by one</p>

    <div>
        <h1>Technique</h1>
        <p>To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

        <p>Universal Selector: 0</p>
        <p>Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1</p>
        <p>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10</p>
        <p>ID selectors: 100</p>
        <p> Inline styles: 1000</p>
    </div>
